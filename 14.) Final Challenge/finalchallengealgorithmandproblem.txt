Challenge: Find the highest profit margin given the dataset as is, include some level of failing gracefully 
           if operations you deem appropriate, do not complete successfully.
	   
Proposed Solution: Assuming file operations may fail

1.) Display welcome message
2.) Verify dataset is available for processing
3.) If data set is available continue to step 4 otherwise continue to step 5
4.) Process data set
	4.1) Get the number of rows in the data set
	4.2) Determine the number of rows that have usable data, store for use later
	4.3) Separate each column of data into separate representations
	4.4) Let user know operation was successful or not by comparing 
	     the size of the represenations to the number of rows with usable data.
	4.5) Continue to step 6
5.) Get data set for processing
	5.1) Notify user about data setabsence
	5.2) Prompt to add data setfor processing
	5.3) Repeat 5.1 & 5.2 until data setis available
	5.4) Continue to step 4
6.) Take the column data with the 'Profit Margin' and find the maximum number in that column representation
7.) Get the row data associated with that maximum number
8.) Display all associated information to user
9.) Exit Program
